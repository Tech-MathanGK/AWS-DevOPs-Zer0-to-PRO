AWS Global Infrastructure
Regions
•	A Region is a geographical area where AWS has multiple data centres.
•	Each Region operates independently from others.
•	Examples of AWS Regions:
	us-east-1 (N. Virginia)
	us-west-2 (Oregon)
	ap-south-1 (Mumbai)
	eu-central-1 (Frankfurt)
•	Regions help with:
	Reducing latency by locating services closer to users.
	Meeting data residency and compliance requirements.
	Allowing disaster recovery between geographically separated areas.

Availability Zones (AZs)
	An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more physically isolated data centers within a Region.
	AZs have independent power, cooling, and networking.
	Each Region has at least two AZs (some have up to six).
	AZs are connected through low-latency, high-throughput, and redundant networking.
•	Key uses of AZs:
	Deploying applications across multiple AZs increases fault tolerance.
	AZs help ensure high availability and disaster recovery within the same Region.

Edge Locations
•	Edge Locations are AWS data centers located globally for content delivery purposes.
1.	Used mainly by services like:
	Amazon CloudFront (Content Delivery Network - CDN)
	AWS Global Accelerator
	AWS Shield and Route 53
•	Benefits of Edge Locations:
	Cache content closer to end-users to reduce latency.
	Improve performance for static and dynamic web content.
	Handle DNS queries faster through Amazon Route 53.
________________________________________
•	Regions = Big geographic locations (contain multiple AZs).
•	Availability Zones = Isolated groups of data centers within a Region.
•	Edge Locations = Global content delivery points (CDN endpoints).
