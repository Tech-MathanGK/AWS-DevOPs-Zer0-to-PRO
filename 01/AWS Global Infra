When you login into AWS Console and you can see Regions and Availability zones in the topright corner. There are 36 geographic regions and 114 Availability Zones (AZs) and 700+ ColudFront (CDN Edge caches) available as of 2025 all over the world. It may increase in future.Lets try to understand the purpose

Regions

In AWS, a Region is a specific geographical location that contains a group of isolated data centers. Each Region is completely independent to ensure the highest levels of fault tolerance and stability. 
AWS has multiple Regions around the world, such as us-east-1 (North Virginia), ap-south-1 (Mumbai), and eu-west-1 (Ireland). When you deploy AWS services, you can choose the Region closest to your users to reduce latency and meet regulatory or compliance requirements related to data residency.

Availability Zones

Inside each Region, AWS has Availability Zones (AZs). An Availability Zone consists of one or more physically separated data centers, each with independent power, networking, and cooling. AZs within a Region are connected with fast, low-latency links, allowing you to design highly available applications by replicating them across multiple AZs. If one AZ experiences an issue, the others continue to operate, minimizing downtime.
For example, when you launch an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 region, you can choose to deploy it in us-east-1a or us-east-1b Availability Zone. If you design your application to span across both AZs, even if us-east-1a faces an outage, your application running in us-east-1b remains available to users.

Edge Locations

Edge Locations are AWS data centers located globally for content delivery purposes. Used mainly by services like Amazon CloudFront (Content Delivery Network - CDN), AWS Global Accelerator, AWS Shield and Route 53
Benefits of Edge Locations:
Cache content closer to end-users to reduce latency.
Improve performance for static and dynamic web content.
Handle DNS queries faster through Amazon Route 53.

In short:
•	Regions help you choose the right location for performance, compliance, and cost.
•	Availability Zones help you build fault-tolerant and highly available systems inside that Region.
•	Edge Locations = Global content delivery points (CDN endpoints).
